# HiCAT

This repository contains the implementation for HiCAT. 

Our Framework is based the code originally presented in the paper [TS2Vec: Towards Universal Representation of Time Series (AAAI-22)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10466). The original code was adapted and improved to enhance performance on classification tasks.

## Datasets

- **128 univariate datasets** from the [UCR Archive](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018/).
- **30 multivariate datasets** from the [UEA Archive](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/).
